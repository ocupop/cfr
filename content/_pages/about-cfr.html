          <p>CFR was started in 1999 by dedicated shredder Dave Basterrechea. Dave started snowboarding in 1987 and was instantly hooked. Snowboarding took Dave all over the world competing and filming until he landed in Whistler BC Canada in 1997.</p>
          <p>Dave started using snowmobiles to get into the backcountry to go snowboarding that year. Snowmobiling quickly became the way to get into the Mountains and access the amazing terrain surrounding the Whistler BC area. Carrying your snowboard in your back pack was the only way to carry your snowboard back then.</p>

          <p>Dave felt that carrying his snowboard on his back was getting in the way of his snowmobiling, especially when tandeming up with another person. Dave built a prototype snowboard rack for his snowmobile in the summer of 1999 and began testing that winter. The design worked. Soon Dave realized that skiers needed racks to carry there skis and poles.</p>
          <p>In 2000 Dave built a rack for skis as well. The CFR snowboard and ski racks were the first snowboard and ski racks available on the market. In 2011 Dave was not happy with the stock handlebars on his snowmobile. They bent easy and he couldn&rsquo;t find the sweet spot on them. After trying all of the other handlebars on the market he decided to design his own. This started the snowmobile control division of CFR.</p>

          <h2 class="mt-5">The Quest for the perfect handlebar had begun</h2>
          <p>The quest for the perfect handlebar had begun. With feedback from all of his team riders a line of signature bars and the flagship Boondocker bar were born. This will be the 4th year of production in handlebars and we have changed them every year to keep tweaking bends, rise and widths. All of the products have been tested in some of the most demanding conditions by snowmobilers, skiers and snowboarders. Bumped out icy trails in the morning and accidental rollovers with Hundreds of hours getting used and abused. CFR products are built to last.</p>
