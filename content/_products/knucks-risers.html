<div class="editable">
            <p>The Knucks Handlebar risers are ideal to personally customize the height of your handlebars and the look of your sled.</p>
            <p>Machined from high strength, super tough 6061 - T06 aluminum they can take anything you can throw at them. The tumbled, anodized finish in a range of colors adds style to your steed and the laser-etched graphics are not just for looks, with a centering line on the top cap allowing you to adjust your handle bars to where you want them. The Knucks come in 1.25", 2", 3", 4", 5", 6", 7" and 8" heights and accept both stock 7/8" or over sized 1 1/8" bars thanks to the integral adapters.</p>
            <p>If you love a clean cockpit as much as we do, finish your new Knucks off with a set of <a href="https://cheetah-factory-racing.netlify.app/products/mountain-strap-adapter/">Mountain Strap Adapter</a> top caps for your Ski-Doo mountain strap and a <a href="https://cheetah-factory-racing.netlify.app/products/handlebar-cluster-relocate/">cluster relocate</a> to get your controls off the bars.</p>
