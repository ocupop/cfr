            <p>We had been custom-making small runs of the Expedition Rack for our close friends for years. We said enough is enough this year and have thrown the big boy into the line up for everyone to enjoy.&nbsp; With an Expedition Rack you can carry enough gear on the back of your snowmobile to keep you going for days. Toys, tools, bags, gas or supplies, the only limit should be your imagination, not your rack. Compatible with all <a href="https://cheetahfactoryracing.com/collections/rack-mounted-bracket-kits">CFR rack mounted bracket kits</a> and <a href="https://cheetahfactoryracing.com/collections/bags">CFR bags</a>.</p>
