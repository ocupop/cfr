            <p>Our universal adapter allows oversized 1 1/8" snowmobile handlebars to be fastened to your stock 7/8" snowmobile clamp. The tear drop design prevents shearing while the laser-etched graphics include centering lines so you can dial in your roll back precisely.</p>
            <p>Available in four anodized colorways; Black, Gold, Blue and Purple</p>
            <p>**You will not need these if you already own or are purchasing risers that accept oversized handlebars.**</p>
