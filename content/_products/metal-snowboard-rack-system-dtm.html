  <p>The snowboard rack tested and approved by snowboarders Eric Jackson, Bjorn Leines and Mads Johnson. The Metal snowboard rack System is one of the lightest snowboard brackets on the market weighing in at 2lbs. Tandem riding with your buddies is now easy as pie with your snowboards on the rack and not in your back packs hitting you in the back of the head. Having snowboards fastened to the snowmobile allows you to negotiate tricky snowmobiling situations getting to your favorite big mountain line or jump spot.</p>

The CFR Top mount Billet bracket (Sold separately) can be purchased if you need to mount the bracket to the top tunnel of your snowmobile.</p>
