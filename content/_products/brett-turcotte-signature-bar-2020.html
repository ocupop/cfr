            <p>&lt;p&gt;The evolution of the Turcotte handlebar is upon us now in its 5th season. Brett&rsquo;s riding style is constantly evolving (along with his X games medals) and because of this his handle bar needs to as well. When Brett switched over to Polaris last year he needed a new handlebar to work with the different dynamics of his new whip. We went to the drawing board and lowered the rise to 1&rdquo; because of the higher steering post design on the Polaris and narrowed the handlebar to 30&rdquo; wide to Brett&rsquo;s liking.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Our entire line up of handlebars is built from the inside out. We start with high quality 7075 double butted heat treated aluminum for a strong and lightweight base. In the center, where the risers stem clamps to the bar, the width is a beefy 1 1/8&rdquo; thick. The handlebar then tapers off to 7/8&rdquo; for your handlebar controls and hands to fit nicely around. This construction also allows energy to dissipate over a gradual tapering thickness within the inner core. This results in a stronger bar that dampens hard hits and also gives the user a better feel of what&rsquo;s going on underneath on the snow. The QR (Quick Rise) technology gives the handlebar more flat bar space using less width. Your hands are also now closer to center allowing more power for flicking snowmobile in tight spaces. The Width is still there for stability and all your stock controls will fit on the handlebars ! Win Win! &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;h2&gt;Important Notes&lt;/h2&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;**&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;span id=":1l4.80" data-g-spell-status="3" class="J-JK9eJ-PJVNOc" tabindex="-1"&gt;Turcotte&lt;/span&gt; bar is an oversized 1 1/8" in the center. A 7/8" to 1 1/8" adapter might be needed depending on the snowmobile riser you have **&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;h2&gt;Product Specs&lt;/h2&gt;<br />&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;1" Rise&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;5&deg;Degree up&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;12&deg;Degree pull back&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;30" Width&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;QR Technology.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Made from 7075 Heat treated super Aluminum with flex technology.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Better positioning than stock bars and way stronger! The cutting edge bends dissipate bumpy conditions better than stock bars keeping you fresh and riding longer!&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;The Turcotte is available in 5 Colorways (Red, Black, White, Purple,Gold and raw aluminum)&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;All Handlebars come with a &lt;span class="J-JK9eJ-PJVNOc" data-g-spell-status="3" id="gmail-:1l4.19" tabindex="-1"&gt;CFR&lt;/span&gt; Bar Pad.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;</p>
