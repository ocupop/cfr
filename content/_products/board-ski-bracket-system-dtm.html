  <p><strong>We have been working on the direct tunnel mount bracket for the past 5 years. The countless molds and R and D have made this our biggest project to date. We are happy to finally get you the new Direct tunnel mount Boardski bracket System.</strong></p>
<p>The demands and expectations of our users of a snowboard/ski bracket are huge. That’s why having the CFR DTM Boardski system released, with our quality and customers expectations all in the design, is such great news! The ability to carry either a pair of skis and or a snowboards with no other rack required is now a reality. Just buy this bracket, bolt it to your snowmobile, throw your skis and or snowboard on and go. This is for the minimalist who doesn't want the rack on the back and just wants to carry his skis and or snowboards depending on their fancy for the day.</p>
<h2>Product Specs</h2>
