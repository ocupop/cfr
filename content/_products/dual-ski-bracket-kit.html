  <p>The CFR Dual Ski Bracket Kit will keep your skis and poles out of the way while breaking trail to yourÂ favourite line or jump spot. This system can be used with another dual ski bracket kit to carry up to two pairs of skis and poles.</p>
<p>When two dual ski bracket kits are being used carrying two pairs of skis and poles it is putting a lot of extra weight on the rear tunnel. Slow down going through rough conditions.
