            <p><strong>The CFR Link It up Rack 2.0 is our newly designed flagship snowmobile rack. Our new Boardski Bracket 2.0 brackets are designed to be used on this new rack also allowing you to carry your skis and or snowboards. The aluminum side plates have been stamped out of sheets of 3mm aerospace aluminum. The plates are bolted together by 20mm-3/4&rdquo;tubes. This creates a strong, bomb proof rack. The UV resistant black anodized coating will keep your rack looking good for many years.</strong></p>
            <p>The Small Link It Up 2.0 rack is fastened to the snowmobile using two Cargo base kits (One on each side of the rack) and allows other accessories to be used on the back of your snowmobile tunnel.</p>
            <p>The Large and extra large Link it up 2.0 use four Linq fasteners for added strength and carrying space.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
