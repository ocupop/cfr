            <p><strong>The 2020 Rooster 2.0 bar is the next generation of the original Rooster bar. The oversized 1 1/8&rdquo; clamp along with the 7075 aluminum create a strong yet damp feeling handlebar. The 28&rdquo; width is designed for riders with narrower shoulders or riders who wanted a narrower handlebar that was not available. The Flat space still allows enough room for all of your controls and brake lever. </strong></p>
            <h2>Important Notes</h2>
            <p><strong>** The Rooster 2.0 is an oversized 1 1/8" in the center and then tapers to 7/8' for your controls and hands to fit around. A 7/8" to 1 1/8" adapter might be needed depending on the snowmobile riser you have **</strong></p>
