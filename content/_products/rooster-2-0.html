            <p><strong></strong></p>
            <p>The Rooster 2.0 is the evolution of our original straight bar. The bar is suitable for a range of different riders, from hill climbers looking for a narrow, precise setup to smaller riders looking to get their hands as low as possible. The 28&rdquo; wide Rooster 2.0 features an oversize 1 1/8&rdquo; diameter clamping area and 12Ëš of pull back.</p>
            <p>Our entire lineup of handlebars is built from the inside out starting with high-quality, double-butted, heat-treated 7075 aluminum for a strong and lightweight base. The center clamping surface is an oversized 1 1/8&rdquo; thick for maximum strength and stiffness and the bars gradually taper to 7/8&rdquo; at the grips for easy control installation and maximum comfort. Our proprietary construction allows energy to dissipate over this gradual tapering thickness within the inner core resulting in a stronger bar that dampens hard hits and also gives the user better feel for what&rsquo;s going on underneath the snow.</p>
