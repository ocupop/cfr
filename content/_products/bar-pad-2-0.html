<div class="editable">
            <p>The newly designed CFR bar pad has a sleeker, meaner and softer design to fit all CFR handlebars or any oversized large diameter handlebars. The dual density foam will protect against sharp corners and hardware on risers. The foam is covered with a cordura that has CFR rubber logos sewed on. The cordura material with stitched logos is long lasting and can with stand pretty much almost anything.</p>
