  <p><strong>Boondocker 2.0 is bent as an all-around Boondock, hill climbing, jump and tandeming handlebar.</strong></p>
  <p>The 38° degree angulation on the end of the bars keep your hands from slipping off. The 10° degree forward bend is
    more comfortable on the wrists when your hands are on the ends of the handlebars.The Boondocker 2.0 is also equipped
    with the revolutionary QR technology.</p>
  <p>Our entire line up of handlebars is built from the inside out. We start with high quality 7075 double butted heat
    treated aluminum for a strong and lightweight base. In the center, where the risers stem clamps to the bar, the width
    is a beefy 1 1/8” thick. The handlebar then tapers off to 7/8” for your handlebar controls and hands to fit nicely
    around. This construction also allows energy to dissipate over a gradual tapering thickness within the inner core.
    This results in a stronger bar that dampens hard hits and also gives the user a better feel of what’s going on
    underneath on the snow. The QR technology gives the handlebar more flat bar space using less width. Your hands are
    also now closer to center allowing more power for flicking snowmobile in tight spaces. The Width is still there for
    stability and all your stock controls will fit on the handlebars ! Win Win!</p>
  <h2>Important Notes</h2>
  <p><strong>** The Boondocker is an oversized 1 1/8" in the center. A 7/8" to 1 1/8" adapter might be needed depending on
      the snowmobile riser you have **</strong><em></em></p>
