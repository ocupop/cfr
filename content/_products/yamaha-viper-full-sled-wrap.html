<div class="editable">
            <p>Sled wraps not only ad style to your whip but also protect the plastic from the abusive sport of snowmobiling. Our graphics are a real hand drawn topo graphical map of one of our favorite snowmobiling areas just west of our headquarters here in Pemberton BC Canada. Each wrap is also numbered and only 1000 total will be made. CFR is working with Toyskinz to produce these wraps witch are made of industry leading 6 mil. vinyl and 15 mil.over-laminate, making a total of 21 mil. thick. Our Colors and designs of the wraps work well with all of our other snowmobile accessories for a tight look!</p>
